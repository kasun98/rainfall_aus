we are going to use the classification algorithms to create a model based on our training data and evaluate our testing data using evaluation metrics.

We will use some of the ML algorithms, specifically:
Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, SVM

We will evaluate our models using:
Accuracy Score, Jaccard Index, F1-Score, LogLoss, Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, R2-Score
